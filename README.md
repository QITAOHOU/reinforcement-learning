# reinforcement-learning

Some reinforcement learning algorithms implemented with Tensorflow 2

For practise I chose [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) Lunar Lander environment.
It is representative and doesn't skip frames like some other envs.

* [Double DQN](https://github.com/vformanyuk/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lunar_lander_doubleDQN.py)
* [Double Dueling DQN](https://github.com/vformanyuk/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lunar_lander_double_dueling_DQN.py)
* [Double Dueling DQN with priority based importance sampling](https://github.com/vformanyuk/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lunar_lander_double_dueling_DQN_IS.py)
* [Vanila Policy Gradient](https://github.com/vformanyuk/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lunar_lander_PolicyGradient.py)
* [Advantage Actor-Critic with MC update](https://github.com/vformanyuk/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lunar_lander_ActorCritic.py)
* [Advantage Actro-Critic with online update, N-returns backup and entropy bonus](https://github.com/vformanyuk/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/lunar_lander_a2c_tdn_entropy.py)
